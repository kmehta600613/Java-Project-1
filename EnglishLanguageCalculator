/*
 
 This program should ask the user to enter 2 single-digit numbers and an operator, calculate the result of the operation, output the 
 description of the operation in plain English as well as the numeric result, and then provide the user with an option to restart. 
 The user should be notified if the number or operation is invalid. Also, any attempts of dividing by 0 should result in the program printing 
 "Division by 0 not allowed".
